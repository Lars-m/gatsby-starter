## Extra for RED students
*This exercise was originally written as a continuation of day-3.*
*It introduces pagination both on the client and on the server as a way to handle large amounts of data.*
*It’s included here only for red students since it’s still very relevant for what we are doing. It’s written as a tutorial, so go ahead if you like*
