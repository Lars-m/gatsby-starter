Understanding Basic Network Terms like: IP, TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP and more.

Most of these exercises are meant to be answered in text, so write down
your replies so you will remember.

1.  What is your *public* IP address right now, and how did you find it?

2.  What is your *private* IP address right now (do this both at home and in school), and who/what gave you that address?

3.  What’s special about these address ranges?
- 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
- 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
- 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

1.  What’s special about this ip-address: 127.0.0.1?

2. What kind of service would you expect to find on a server using these ports: 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443?

3.  What is the IP address of studypoints.dk and how did you find it?

4.  If you write [*https://studypoints.dk*](https://mystudypoints.dk) in your browser, how did “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?

5.  Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both

6.  What is your (nearest) DNS server?

7.  What is (conceptually) the DNS system and the purpose with a DNS Server?

8.  What is your current Gateway, and how did you find it?

9.  What is the address of your current DHCP-Server, and how did you find it?

10. Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack

11. Explain about the HTTP Protocol (the following exercises will go much deeper into this protocol)

12. Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where does it fit into TCP/IP)
