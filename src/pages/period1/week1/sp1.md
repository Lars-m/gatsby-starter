## Part-1 (Complete all exercises (according to your colour level) from this week)

<!--PeriodExercises period1/week1 PeriodExercises--> 

## Part-2 Group Document

__This is a group exercise__

Setup a group document, outlining the guidelines for how you plan to work together as a group throughout the semester, as explained in this here:

### How to hand-in your group guidelines TBD

## Part-3 Reflections on what you did this week
__This is both an individual exercise and a group exercise__

So far you have continued with test and JUnit which you were expected to know from previous semesters. 

We have introduced Maven, and how to use Maven to do Unit tests, Integrations tests, generate documentation and deploy your War-files. And finally we have introduced the concept of Continuous Integration (CI), and Travis to do CI for real.

These are all topics we expect you to use, as a minimum, for all CA’s and the semester project, so:

**Individual)**: Spend 10-20 min by yourself to come up with a set of guidelines, explaining how and what to do for a future project that must be able to:
1. Unit Test all “relevant” public methods via Maven
2. Exclude integration tests from your unit test, and why this is necessary
3. Perform integration tests, and only integration tests, via maven’s verify phase
4. How and what to do, to test a Tomcat based WEB-API, via maven’s verify phase
5. How and what to do, to deploy your code via maven.
6. How and what to do, to integrate your project with Travis

**Group)** Sit down with your group, and combine your efforts from the previous step into a document with the title “Test, Maven and Travis Guidelines”. You must publish this document somewhere. To prevent the need for “billions” of links, we suggest you add it to the Group Document created in part 2.
