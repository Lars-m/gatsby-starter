### Object Relational Mapping with JPA

Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. 


This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.


We will use Java and JPA this semester, but all serious languages/platforms out there offers similar API's


### Business competences

This week will enable you to work with databases through an Object Relational Mapping Framework. 
The focus is on java/JPA, but the core concepts are widely applicable in almost all technologies "out there".
