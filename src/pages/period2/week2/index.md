### REST

REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.

We will use Java and JAX-RS to implement RESTful systems this semester

### Business competences
REST is today, in year 2019,  more or less considered the standard protocol for web APIs. 

REST has grown in use rapidly since 2005 and chances are very HIGH that you will end up using RESTful in your future life as a developer.
